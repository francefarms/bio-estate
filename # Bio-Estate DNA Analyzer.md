# Bio-Estate DNA Analyzer
**A Bioinformatics tool for genomic sequence stability analysis.**

## 🔬 Overview
This project was developed to apply computational biology techniques to agricultural data. It analyzes DNA sequences to determine nucleotide frequency, GC-content, and the Purine/Pyrimidine ratio—key indicators of genetic stability.

## 🚀 Features
- **Nucleotide Counting:** Precise frequency analysis of A, T, G, and C.
- **GC-Content Calculation:** Critical for understanding DNA melting points and stability.
- **Purine/Pyrimidine Ratios:** Provides molecular weight insights for the sequence.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Environment:** Linux (Ubuntu)
- **Version Control:** Git/GitHub

## 📖 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/francefarms/bio-estate.git`
2. Run the analyzer:
   `python3 dna_analyzer.py`
